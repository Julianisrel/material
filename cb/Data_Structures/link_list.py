# linked lists store references as part of their own elements.
"""
Before going more in depth on what linked lists are and how you can use them, you should first learn how they are structured. Each element of a linked list is called a node, and every node has two different fields:

    Data contains the value to be stored in the node.
    Next contains a reference to the next node on the list.


Practical Applications

Linked lists serve a variety of purposes in the real world. 
They can be used to implement (spoiler alert!) queues or stacks as well as graphs. 
Theyâ€™re also useful for much more complex tasks, such as lifecycle management for an operating system application.
